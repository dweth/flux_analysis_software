# single-cell-snac

The Single Cell Signaling Network Analysis Code, or Single Cell SNAC, is a set of files designed to allow anyone to analyze signaling network kinetics of interest from large mass cytometry datasets.

The documents contained in this repository include:
1. Before Running
   -These are instructions for installing and downloading all the necessary prerequisites to run the software.
2. Instructions
   -These are instructions as to how to use the code once you have the necessary prerequisites.
3. drag_me_to_terminal.py
   -This file is the main file of the program.  It executes much of the code, and calls the other scripts in the repository.
4. new_align.f
   -This file organizes the necessary files in a new directory.  It "preps" for the Simulated Annealing scheme.
5. Monte_Carlo.f
   -This file executes the Simulated Annealing scheme.
